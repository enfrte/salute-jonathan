## Chapter 2


Now the man is in the train.


He is not in Munich; he is in a train.


He travels.


He thinks: "Now I travel from Munich to Vienna.


It is a good journey.


I love journeys."


He thinks about Munich.


He thinks: "Now I am in the train, but yesterday I was in Munich.


And now I write a journal in the train, but yesterday I wrote a journal in Munich.


And now I think in the train, but yesterday I thought in Munich.


Yesterday I thought about Munich in Munich, and now I think about Vienna in the train.


Now I am in the train, not in Vienna.


But I think and write about Vienna."


Does the man now think in Munich?


No, he now does not think in Munich.


He thinks in the train.


Yesterday he thought in Munich.


He says: "Hello, train!"


The man is in the train, and he travels to a city.


The city is not Munich; Munich is the city of yesterday.


The city is Vienna; Vienna is the city of today.


The man thinks about Munich and Vienna.


He thinks: "Munich was the city of yesterday, and Munich was good.


Now it is today, and I am in a train; the train is good.


Will Vienna be good?"


The man thinks about Munich: Munich was the city of yesterday.


He thinks in the train: he is in the train today.


And he thinks about Vienna: Vienna will be the city of tomorrow.


And he thinks: "Munich was big.


The train is big.


Will Vienna be big?"


And he thinks: "In Munich I wrote in a journal.


In the train I write in a journal.


Will I write in a journal in Vienna?


Yes, tomorrow in Vienna I will write in a journal.


I love journals."


The man thinks a lot (he thinks a lot = he thinks and thinks and thinks), and he writes a lot.


Yes, he is an intelligent man.


Intelligent men write a lot, and think a lot.


He is Jonathan; Jonathan is an intelligent man.


He writes: "I am Jonathan.


I am in a train.


Yesterday I stood in Munich; tomorrow I will stand in Vienna."


He thinks, and writes: "The train...it is good, but old.


It is not new; it is old.


Are the trains in Munich old?


Yes, the trains of Munich are old.


But the trains of Munich are good, and I love the trains of Munich.


Yesterday I loved the train in Munich, and today I love the train now, and tomorrow I will love the train in Vienna.


I love trains!"


Jonathan writes: "Munich is a good city and an old city, and Vienna is a good city and an old city.


Munich and Vienna are not new, but are good.


Munich and Vienna are old, but good cities.


The cities are not new, but good.


I love cities!"


Jonathan thinks that the second day of travel is good.


He says: "Today was a good second day of travel.


I love journeys!"


## Chapter 3


Jonathan stands in Vienna: the city of Vienna.


Jonathan thinks that Vienna is good, and that Vienna is beautiful.


Jonathan does not think that Vienna is ugly; he thinks that Vienna is beautiful.


He says: "Vienna is a beautiful city! I will write about it!"


And he writes in the journal about Vienna.


In the journal he writes: "My third day is very good! 


On the second day I stood in Munich. 


But now I stand in Vienna: Vienna is not Munich."


Munich and Vienna are two cities; Munich is not Vienna and Vienna is not Munich.


I stand in Vienna and the city is very beautiful.


I love Vienna; the city is not ugly.


How beautiful is Vienna! But I have a problem."


What? Jonathan has a problem? What problem?


Now he does not see the journal; he sees the city and thinks.


He thinks a lot about the problem.


Jonathan's problem is that he loves Vienna, but he does not have time.


He thinks: "Hmm... Now it is seven (7) o'clock. 


At ten (10) o'clock the train departs."


Ten (10) hours minus seven (7) hours is three (3) hours.


Three hours is not much time for a beautiful city!


I do not have time.


Having time is good, but I do not have it!


Writing a journal is good, but I do not have time to write it!


What to do in Vienna?"


He thinks: "I do not have much time. 


What to do - write a journal, or eat, or see the city? What will I do?"


He thinks more, and says: "I have a good idea! 


One moment...Let me think. 


My train departs at ten (10) o'clock. 


Is there a train later, at eleven (11) o'clock, or twelve (12), thirteen (13), fourteen (14) or fifteen (15) o'clock?"


He looks...yes! 


There is a train which departs at fifteen o'clock.


Now Jonathan is happy.


Jonathan says: "Fifteen (15) minus seven (7) is eight (8). 


Now I have eight hours of time! 


What will I do?"


He says: "I know! I will eat a steak. 


And I will drink a beer. 


One moment...no, I will drink two beers, or three beers. 


Good idea!"


Now Jonathan drinks a beer in Vienna, and eats a steak.


He is happy.


He says: "How happy I am! I love the city of Vienna. 


How I love journeys!"


## Chapter 4 


Where is Jonathan? 


Is he in Vienna? 


No, he is in a different city. 


He is in Bistritz. 


What is Bistritz? 


It is a city in Romania. 


Now begins the journey in Romania.


Jonathan writes in his journal: "The first of May I was in Munich. 


The second of May I was in Vienna. 


Then I was in Budapest. 


Budapest was beautiful. 


But I didn't have time in Budapest. 


I saw the streets in Budapest. 


In Budapest I thought: here ends the west, and here begins the east. 


Budapest is different."


He thinks a bit more about Budapest. 


He thinks: "I am a person who comes from England, from London. 


I speak English, because the people in England speak English. 


But in Budapest I didn't speak with people in English; I spoke in German. 


My German isn't good, but the people in Budapest don't speak English. 


We spoke in German. 


It is interesting that the people in Budapest speak German."


Now Jonathan thinks about his journey. 


He thinks: "I was in the museum in London. 


In the museum were books about another land. 


I read the books. 


In the museum were maps about another land. 


I saw the maps. 


The books and maps said that the other land is far away, but interesting. 


In the other land are many people, many different people."


Now Jonathan thinks more about his journey.


He thinks: "Yesterday I was in Klausenburg.


I ate in Klausenburg.


The name of the food was 'paprika hendl'.


It is very good, the food in Klausenburg.


The hotel was good, but I didn't sleep well.


But the land is very beautiful! 


In the train I saw many villages and many castles.


A city is bigger than a village, but the villages are very beautiful.


A castle is bigger than a hotel, and more beautiful than a hotel! 


Villages are smaller than cities, but they are beautiful, and hotels are smaller than castles."


Jonathan writes more in his journal: "Bistritz is an interesting place.


Bistritz is an old place, older than other places.


Also my hotel in Bistritz is old, older than other hotels.


In the hotel I said my name: 'I am Jonathan Harker' and they said to me: 'Welcome to the hotel.' 


In the hotel I saw a letter for me.


Now I will read my letter."


Jonathan reads his letter.


It says: My friend. - Welcome.


Sleep well.


I am in Bukovina, please come to Bukovina.


Was the journey from London good? My land is very beautiful.


Welcome to my land.


Your friend, DRACULA.


Jonathan reads the letter and thinks about his friend Count Dracula.


Who is he? 


He doesn't know.


But his friend is interesting.


Also the village Bistritz is interesting.


Jonathan is happy, and thinks about his friend.


Then he sleeps.
