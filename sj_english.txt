He thinks.

He thinks about the city.

He thinks: "What is the city? Is the city good? Is the city big?"

The man stands and thinks: "Where is the train?"

He thinks: "The train!"

Now he does not think about the journal and does not think about the city; he thinks about the train! 



## Chapter 2


Now the man is in the train.


He is not in Munich; he is in a train.


He travels.


He thinks: "Now I travel from Munich to Vienna.


It is a good journey.


I love journeys."


He thinks about Munich.


He thinks: "Now I am in the train, but yesterday I was in Munich.


And now I write a journal in the train, but yesterday I wrote a journal in Munich.


And now I think in the train, but yesterday I thought in Munich.


Yesterday I thought about Munich in Munich, and now I think about Vienna in the train.


Now I am in the train, not in Vienna.


But I think and write about Vienna."


Does the man now think in Munich?


No, he now does not think in Munich.


He thinks in the train.


Yesterday he thought in Munich.


He says: "Hello, train!"


The man is in the train, and he travels to a city.


The city is not Munich; Munich is the city of yesterday.


The city is Vienna; Vienna is the city of today.


The man thinks about Munich and Vienna.


He thinks: "Munich was the city of yesterday, and Munich was good.


Now it is today, and I am in a train; the train is good.


Will Vienna be good?"


The man thinks about Munich: Munich was the city of yesterday.


He thinks in the train: he is in the train today.


And he thinks about Vienna: Vienna will be the city of tomorrow.


And he thinks: "Munich was big.


The train is big.


Will Vienna be big?"


And he thinks: "In Munich I wrote in a journal.


In the train I write in a journal.


Will I write in a journal in Vienna?


Yes, tomorrow in Vienna I will write in a journal.


I love journals."


The man thinks a lot (he thinks a lot = he thinks and thinks and thinks), and he writes a lot.


Yes, he is an intelligent man.


Intelligent men write a lot, and think a lot.


He is Jonathan; Jonathan is an intelligent man.


He writes: "I am Jonathan.


I am in a train.


Yesterday I stood in Munich; tomorrow I will stand in Vienna."


He thinks, and writes: "The train...it is good, but old.


It is not new; it is old.


Are the trains in Munich old?


Yes, the trains of Munich are old.


But the trains of Munich are good, and I love the trains of Munich.


Yesterday I loved the train in Munich, and today I love the train now, and tomorrow I will love the train in Vienna.


I love trains!"


Jonathan writes: "Munich is a good city and an old city, and Vienna is a good city and an old city.


Munich and Vienna are not new, but are good.


Munich and Vienna are old, but good cities.


The cities are not new, but good.


I love cities!"


Jonathan thinks that the second day of travel is good.


He says: "Today was a good second day of travel.


I love journeys!"


## Chapter 3


Jonathan stands in Vienna: the city of Vienna.


Jonathan thinks that Vienna is good, and that Vienna is beautiful.


Jonathan does not think that Vienna is ugly; he thinks that Vienna is beautiful.


He says: "Vienna is a beautiful city! I will write about it!"


And he writes in the journal about Vienna.


In the journal he writes: "My third day is very good! 


On the second day I stood in Munich. 


But now I stand in Vienna: Vienna is not Munich."


Munich and Vienna are two cities; Munich is not Vienna and Vienna is not Munich.


I stand in Vienna and the city is very beautiful.


I love Vienna; the city is not ugly.


How beautiful is Vienna! But I have a problem."


What? Jonathan has a problem? What problem?


Now he does not see the journal; he sees the city and thinks.


He thinks a lot about the problem.


Jonathan's problem is that he loves Vienna, but he does not have time.


He thinks: "Hmm... Now it is seven (7) o'clock. 


At ten (10) o'clock the train departs."


Ten (10) hours minus seven (7) hours is three (3) hours.


Three hours is not much time for a beautiful city!


I do not have time.


Having time is good, but I do not have it!


Writing a journal is good, but I do not have time to write it!


What to do in Vienna?"


He thinks: "I do not have much time. 


What to do - write a journal, or eat, or see the city? What will I do?"


He thinks more, and says: "I have a good idea! 


One moment...Let me think. 


My train departs at ten (10) o'clock. 


Is there a train later, at eleven (11) o'clock, or twelve (12), thirteen (13), fourteen (14) or fifteen (15) o'clock?"


He looks...yes! 


There is a train which departs at fifteen o'clock.


Now Jonathan is happy.


Jonathan says: "Fifteen (15) minus seven (7) is eight (8). 


Now I have eight hours of time! 


What will I do?"


He says: "I know! I will eat a steak. 


And I will drink a beer. 


One moment...no, I will drink two beers, or three beers. 


Good idea!"


Now Jonathan drinks a beer in Vienna, and eats a steak.


He is happy.


He says: "How happy I am! I love the city of Vienna. 


How I love journeys!"


## Chapter 4 


Where is Jonathan? 


Is he in Vienna? 


No, he is in a different city. 


He is in Bistritz. 


What is Bistritz? 


It is a city in Romania. 


Now begins the journey in Romania.


Jonathan writes in his journal: "The first of May I was in Munich. 


The second of May I was in Vienna. 


Then I was in Budapest. 


Budapest was beautiful. 


But I didn't have time in Budapest. 


I saw the streets in Budapest. 


In Budapest I thought: here ends the west, and here begins the east. 


Budapest is different."


He thinks a bit more about Budapest. 


He thinks: "I am a person who comes from England, from London. 


I speak English, because the people in England speak English. 


But in Budapest I didn't speak with people in English; I spoke in German. 


My German isn't good, but the people in Budapest don't speak English. 


We spoke in German. 


It is interesting that the people in Budapest speak German."


Now Jonathan thinks about his journey. 


He thinks: "I was in the museum in London. 


In the museum were books about another land. 


I read the books. 


In the museum were maps about another land. 


I saw the maps. 


The books and maps said that the other land is far away, but interesting. 


In the other land are many people, many different people."


Now Jonathan thinks more about his journey.


He thinks: "Yesterday I was in Klausenburg.


I ate in Klausenburg.


The name of the food was 'paprika hendl'.


It is very good, the food in Klausenburg.


The hotel was good, but I didn't sleep well.


But the land is very beautiful! 


In the train I saw many villages and many castles.


A city is bigger than a village, but the villages are very beautiful.


A castle is bigger than a hotel, and more beautiful than a hotel! 


Villages are smaller than cities, but they are beautiful, and hotels are smaller than castles."


Jonathan writes more in his journal: "Bistritz is an interesting place.


Bistritz is an old place, older than other places.


Also my hotel in Bistritz is old, older than other hotels.


In the hotel I said my name: 'I am Jonathan Harker' and they said to me: 'Welcome to the hotel.' 


In the hotel I saw a letter for me.


Now I will read my letter."


Jonathan reads his letter.


It says: My friend. - Welcome.


Sleep well.


I am in Bukovina, please come to Bukovina.


Was the journey from London good? My land is very beautiful.


Welcome to my land.


Your friend, DRACULA.


Jonathan reads the letter and thinks about his friend Count Dracula.


Who is he? 


He doesn't know.


But his friend is interesting.


Also the village Bistritz is interesting.


Jonathan is happy, and thinks about his friend.


Then he sleeps.

## Chapter 5
## Luku 5

Quaresim May (= 4 May)

Today Jonathan will travel to Count Dracula's place.

In the hotel he sees the hotelier, and sees a letter from Count Dracula in the hotelier's hand.

He says to the hotelier in German: "Hello, please give me the letter."

The hotelier gives him the letter.

Then he asks in German: "What is the letter? What did Dracula write in the letter?"

But the hotelier says: "I do not speak German, I do not speak German."

Jonathan thinks: "Strange! Yesterday I spoke with the hotelier in German, and now he says he does not speak German! Why?"

He asks the hotelier: "Do you know who Count Dracula is?" but now the hotelier does not speak.

Jonathan thinks: "Strange! I spoke with the hotelier in German. 

He must speak German, but he says he does not speak it! 

I should ask more, but I have no time. 

I must depart."

Now Jonathan is in his room in the hotel.

After an hour he must depart.

But look! An old woman comes to his room.

The old woman: "Why are you leaving? 

Please do not depart! 

Today is not a good day! 

It is a bad day, a day with bad things!"

Jonathan: "I am good, I am going to see a friend. 

Please do not talk about bad things."

The old woman: "Do you not know that today is Saint George's Day? 

At decided (12) hours the bad things will come! 

Do you know where you are going?"

Jonathan: "No no, everything is good. 

I am good, and today bad things will not come."

The old woman: "Please do not depart! 

Please do not depart!"

Jonathan: "No, I must depart. 

Please do not cry."

The old woman: "Look at a crucifix. 

The crucifix is for you."

Jonathan: "Ah...the English do not like crucifixes...but thank you. 

Please do not cry."

Jonathan thinks: "In England we love crosses, but not crucifixes. 

In Romania people love crucifixes, not crosses."

Now the old woman goes and Jonathan is alone in his room.

He thinks: "This place is strange! 

An old woman who gives crucifixes! But I must depart."

## Chapter 6

Today Jonathan will go to the castle of his friend Count Dracula.
The journey to the castle begins now.
Jonathan stands before the carriage and waits for the coachman.
"Where is the coachman?" he thinks.
"Ah, there's the coachman – he talks with the hotelier."
"What are they talking about?"
"I have no time and I must depart."
Jonathan looks around the carriage and sees many people.
The people talk a lot, but he does not understand the people.
Jonathan thinks: "Why are they sad?"
"I am not sad."
"I think this is a strange place, but I am not sad."
He sees that the people talk and move their hands.
He sees their hands...what are they doing with their hands?
Ah! Now he understands.
They move their hands like a crucifix.
Their hands are not crucifixes, but when they move their hands, their hands are like crucifixes.
The coachman comes.
Now the journey begins.
Jonathan sits in the carriage.
The other people also sit in the carriage.
Jonathan sees the land around him and thinks that it is beautiful.
There are many trees.
In this land there are many apples and many plums, because there are many apple trees and plum trees.
He says: "Mmm! The apple trees are very beautiful, and I want to eat their apples."
He also sees pears, because there are many pear trees in this land.
He says: "Very good! The pear trees are very beautiful, and I want to eat their pears."
"I love the trees of the forest."
But the carriage continues, and continues...it is a very fast carriage!
Why does the carriage go so fast?
He sees the road, which is not a good road; it is old.
But the carriage goes fast!
"Should the carriage go fast if the road is old and not a good road?" he thinks.
The coachman likes to go fast, he thinks.
Now the carriage goes into a forest.
Far away he sees mountains.
The mountains are very large, and the forest is also very large.
Jonathan thinks about the mountains in England.
He thinks that the mountains in England are very small, smaller than the mountains in Romania.
Outside the carriage Jonathan sees, from time to time, other people.
They are people of this land.
This land has different people than the people in that land, England.
The people in this land live in the forest, but the people in that land, England, live in the large cities.
And he thinks about the cross and the crucifix.
Yes, the people in this land, Romania, love crucifixes, but the people in that land, England, love crosses.
What time is it?
It is six o'clock.
When Jonathan sat in the carriage it was morning.
Later came midday.
Midday is 12 o'clock.
Then came afternoon; afternoon is the time after 12 o'clock.
But now it is evening.
What is evening?
Evening is the hour when the sun is not high, but low.
Now the sun is very low.
When Jonathan was in the carriage at midday, it was warm.
At midday Jonathan thought: "I am warm! I must drink!"
But now, when it is six o'clock, the sun is low, and it is not warm; it is cold.
Now he thinks: "I am cold! Where is the sun?"
When Jonathan is warm, it is warm, and when he is cold, it is cold.
Jonathan does not want to be warm, but he does not want to be cold either.
He does not like to be warm, but now he does not like to be cold.
Jonathan says again: "Where is the sun?" and he says: "When will the journey end?"
"Where is the castle of my friend Count Dracula?"

### Chapter 7

The coach goes, and it goes; it continues to go.  
Jonathan sees many things from the coach. 
He is in the coach, and the things not in the coach; he sees them from the coach.  
He sees crosses, many crosses.  
Jonathan asks the coachman: "Can I get out of the coach?"  
The coachman: "No. There are many dogs. You cannot."  
Jonathan: "What? There are many dogs?"
The coachman: "Yes. And also outside the coach, you will see many dogs."  
The coachman laughs.  
Jonathan thinks: "Why is he laughing?"

Now it is night; there is no sun.  
The coach goes faster and faster.  
The people in the coach say to the coachman: "Go faster!"  
Jonathan thinks: "Why go so fast?"  
Jonathan sees very large mountains from the coach.  
Jonathan sees that the people in the coach are very excited; they talk a lot.  
The people in the coach say excitedly: "Go faster!"

Now the coach stops.  
They are in a pass between the mountains.  
Jonathan knows that here he will see the coach to go to his friend Count Dracula, but where is it?  
In front of Jonathan is the road, and only the road.  
The people in the coach are happy.  
But Jonathan is not happy. 
"Why come here where there is no coach to go to my friend Dracula?"

The coachman speaks to a person in the coach: "We have been quick. 
We have arrived here an hour early."  
The coachman spoke with a low voice, but Jonathan heard him.  
Jonathan thinks: "Why is it good to have arrived here an hour early?"

Now the coachman speaks to Jonathan with a loud voice.  
He says: "Jonathan, the Herr (German: the Count) will not come here today. 
He will go to another city, the city of Bukovina. 
Perhaps tomorrow the Herr will come here. 
Perhaps yes, perhaps no. 
I do not know. 
We must leave."

Jonathan is sad and thinks: "Why is Count Dracula not here? 
Why must I leave?"

But, what is that?  
The horses are excited.  
Also, the people in the coach are excited.  
Jonathan looks, and there he sees another coach, larger, with four horses.  
The new coach is richer and larger than the coach in which Jonathan is sitting.  
The four horses are black and very large.  
In the new coach, Jonathan sees another coachman.  
The other coachman is large, tall, and has a beard.  
The beard and the strong hands of the coachman make Jonathan think he is a very strong man.  
But Jonathan cannot see the face of the other coachman.

The other coachman says: "You have arrived here quickly, my friend."

The coachman: "Ah...the English Herr wanted to go quickly..."

The other coachman: "I know that you wanted to go to Bukovina. 
Yes, I know what you are thinking. 
I am more intelligent than you. 
Give me the luggage of the English Sir."

The coachman gives Jonathan's luggage to the other coachman.  
The other coachman is very strong; Jonathan sees that he is strong when he sees his hands.  
The other coachman takes the luggage with his strong hands, and very quickly the task is finished.

Now Jonathan sits in the other coach.  
Today has been a long day for Jonathan.  
But now the other journey begins.


## Chapter 8

Now Jonathan sits in the large coach with the coachman.  
The coachman speaks in excellent German: "The night is cold, my Sir.  
This is brandy, a drink made from plums.  
Please drink it if you want to drink."  

Jonathan does not drink. 
But he thought it was good that he had brandy to drink.  
Jonathan waits and thinks about the journey.  

The coach goes quickly.  
Then, the coachman turns the coach (he turned it once).  
And he turns the coach – twice.  
What? He turns the coach... three times!  
He turns it again, and again.  
Jonathan thinks: "Are we not passing the same way, once and again? 
How strange!"  
But Jonathan does not question the coachman, who is very large and very strong.  

Jonathan wonders what time it is.  
He looks at his watch.  
The watch shows the time: it is twelve o'clock.  
Ah... twelve o'clock, it is midnight.  
Jonathan knows that the people in Romania had spoken to him about midnight, about twelve o'clock, and they said that twelve o'clock is a bad time.  

Now Jonathan hears a sound, the sound of many dogs.  
The sound is very loud!  
The dogs say: Ulu! Ulu!  
Yes, the dogs howl.  
The horses do not like the howling of the dogs.  
Then Jonathan hears the howling of wolves.  
The howling of the wolves is even louder than the howling of the dogs.  
The horses really do not like the wolves howling.  

The coachman says to the horses: "Be calm."  
And the horses calm themselves.  
The horses are calm and continue going.  

Now Jonathan sees a forest: he sees many trees and knows it is a forest.  
And he hears the wind.  
Even the wind says: Ulu! Ulu!  
Here in the forest, even the wind howls.  
Jonathan does not like the howling of the wind.  

Now Jonathan sees another thing: the snow.  
It is truly cold!  
One only sees snow when it is freezing.  

What does the coachman do?  
He drives the coach.  
He does not speak about the wolves, he does not speak about the mountain, he only drives the coach.  
But when Jonathan sees a blue flame, the coachman stops the coach and goes to see it.  
Later Jonathan sees the flames, once, twice, many times.  
Jonathan does not know what the blue flames are.  

The coachman stops the coach and goes far away.  
Now Jonathan is alone with the horses.  
He sees the wolves once again.  
The wolves do not howl; they are silent.  
Jonathan sees the moon and thinks: "Where is the coachman? Why does he not come?"  
The horses do not like the silent wolves.  

Seeing the moon, the wolves begin to howl.  
Hearing the howling wolves, the horses begin to move.  
Jonathan knocks on the coach.  
Knocking on the coach, he says: "Where are you, coachman? 
Where have you gone?"  

Jonathan hears a voice; it is the coachman.  
The coachman says: "Away, wolves!"  
And the wolves go away; now the wolves are gone, and Jonathan does not see the wolves.  
Seeing the moving coachman, he thinks: "The coachman is truly, truly strong."  

The coach continues.  
Now one cannot see the moon because there are clouds.  
Jonathan sits in the moving coach.  
The coach goes higher and higher.  
Seeing the clouds and thinking about the journey, Jonathan now wants to sleep.  

Now Jonathan knows nothing more.  
He begins to sleep and does not know what the coachman does.  
The sleeping Jonathan does not see that the coach has arrived at Dracula's castle.  


## Chapter 9

The coach stands in front of the castle with the sleeping Jonathan.  
But after a moment, he is no longer asleep: he is awake.  
"What! I am in front of the castle!" he thinks.  
He sees the castle in the night, and it seems very, very large.  
The castle seems to be interesting; it interests him.  
But it is night, and Jonathan is not very happy; he thinks about the wolves and the bad things during the journey.  
However, Jonathan is a little happy because he has arrived at the castle.  
He thinks about food and drink and about sleeping in a good bed.  

Thinking about these things, he sees the door.  
How to enter?  
The coachman is gone, Jonathan is alone, and the door is large.  
Thinking again about the strong coachman, he looks at the door.  
What to do?  
The door is silent, and it is enormous.  
Standing in front of the door, Jonathan thinks about what to do.  
Jonathan thinks: "Should I sleep?"  
But no, Jonathan knows he is not going to sleep.  

Jonathan stands in front of the door; he is not behind the door.  
In front of the door is the night; behind the door is the castle.  
But now Jonathan hears a sound behind the door: KRRRRR... CHIKKK...  
The door opens (someone opens the door).  

Behind the door, Jonathan sees a man.  
He is tall, old, and has a long white mustache (not a beard).  
It is Count Dracula.  

"Welcome, Jonathan! 
Please come in!" says Dracula.  
Dracula takes Jonathan's hand.  
Oh! Dracula is also very strong, and his hand is cold.  
Jonathan says to himself: "This hand of Dracula does not seem alive; is he alive? 
It seems dead! ...no, don't think stupid thoughts, Jonathan! 
He is alive; he is a man. 
He is a living man."  

Dracula continues speaking: "I am Dracula, and welcome to my home.  
The night is cold, and you must eat, and you must sleep.  
Please give me your luggage."  

Jonathan: "My luggage? But you are a gentleman, and in your castle, there are other people who..."

Dracula: "No, you are my friend, and my people are sleeping. 
Please give me your luggage."  

Dracula begins walking with the luggage; Jonathan follows him.  
The castle is truly large, and while following Dracula, Jonathan sees many things: stairs, windows, and other things.  
Now they stand in front of a large door.  
Dracula opens the door, and they see a room.  
In the room, Jonathan sees a fire (a fire is many flames) and water.  
Jonathan wants to wash himself with the water because the journey was long.  

Dracula says: "Please wash yourself with the water.  
And after washing yourself with the water, please come to the other room to eat."  

Jonathan thinks: "Oh, there is food! I must wash quickly. 
I really want to eat."  

Later, after washing, Jonathan enters the other room.  
He sees the food.  
Dracula sits in front of a large fire.  
He moves his hand and says: "Please eat. 
I have already eaten."  

Jonathan says: "Before I eat, I have something to give you. 
Here is a letter from London. 
My boss wrote the letter."  

Dracula opens the letter, reads it, and is happy.  
He gives the letter to Jonathan and says: "Your boss said good things about you. 
Now you can also read the letter."  

Jonathan reads the letter and sees that, yes, his boss in London wrote good things about him.  
In the letter, Jonathan's boss wrote that Jonathan is intelligent, a good man, and quiet.  
Now Jonathan thinks about why he is in Dracula's castle.  
He is in his castle because Dracula said he wanted to buy houses in London.  
Dracula has much money and wants to buy houses, and he wrote letters to Jonathan's firm saying: "Please help me buy houses in London."  

Now Dracula shows the food: it is chicken with cheese.  
While Jonathan eats, the Count questions him about the journey.  
The Count wants to know many things about England, about the journey, and about Jonathan.  
After eating, the Count gives him a cigar, and Jonathan takes it.  
But Dracula tells him that he does not smoke cigars, and Jonathan smokes the cigar alone.  
Jonathan looks at Dracula again and thinks: this man is very, very pale, and very strong. 
A very pale and very strong man.  

Now the two men are silent.  
Jonathan looks out the window; the morning will soon arrive.  
But Jonathan can still hear the howling of the wolves.  
Dracula says: "Listen to them! 
They make music!"  
Jonathan thinks that Dracula has said a strange thing.  

Dracula continues: "Ah, you are a city man; you come from a city. 
City people cannot understand.  
But good – you have had a long journey, and you must sleep.  
Tomorrow I have many things to do.  
I will see you later."  

Now Jonathan enters his room.  
He writes in his journal: "Two hours ago, I was in a coach.  
Now I am in the castle.  
In two hours, I will be sleeping because I will soon sleep."  
He writes more things, and then he sleeps.  


## Chapter 10

Jonathan has slept well, and it is after midday.  
He wakes up, washes himself, and enters the room where he and the Count had eaten.  
There he finds a cold breakfast (a breakfast is the meal one eats in the morning).  
But he also finds coffee, and the coffee is not cold; it is warm.  
He sees a small note on which is written:  

"I will be away for a time. Please do not wait for me. – D."  

Jonathan thinks: "Good! Let's eat!" And he eats.  

After eating, Jonathan wants to find someone to clean the table.  
But... no one!  
Jonathan is alone in the castle.  
He begins walking and looking at the other rooms.  
On the tables are many beautiful things.  
Now he thinks that even his bed is very beautiful.  
Dracula must be very, very rich.  
He sees things made of gold and silver.  
But among these things, he cannot find a mirror!  
He sees golden cups, but no mirror.  
He sees silver tables, but no mirror!  
Very strange!  
Jonathan laughs.  

Jonathan enters another room... wonderful!  
He finds what he was looking for: books.  
And among the books, he finds many written in English.  
Many books are about England: the history of England, the geography of England, and many other topics.  
Jonathan sees that the Count has learned much about the history and geography of England.  
This is good.  

Now Dracula enters the room.  
Dracula says: "My friend! You have found my books about England.  
Yes, I want to know everything about England.  
I have never been to England, but I think I love your country.  
I want to see the streets of London, see the many people, I want to live with it, and see what it is like.  
But alas! I have learned the English language only by reading books."  

Jonathan: "But Count, you speak English very well!"  

Dracula: "Thank you, but I have learned only the grammar and the words.  
But I do not speak it well."  

Jonathan: "But you really do speak it very well."  

Dracula: "Yes, but if I were in London, people would not think I am an Englishman.  
They would see me and think: 'That man is a foreigner.'  
I want to speak better English, so people do not think I am a foreigner.  
Please tell me when I do not speak good English; I want to learn more."  

Jonathan: "Very well, I will help you learn better English."  

Dracula: "Thank you! You will stay in my castle for a good time.  
We have many things to do.  
Ah, I must tell you something important:  
You may go wherever you want in the castle, except for the locked doors.  
The doors are locked because... because there are things you must not know about in the castle.  
Do you understand?"  

Jonathan: "Yes, of course." (Jonathan wanted the Count to know that he understood well.)  

Dracula: "Yes, in Transylvania, where we are, things are different.  
Transylvania is not England, and you will think that things here are strange.  
But you have already seen many strange things, haven't you?"  

Jonathan: "Yes, of course! Many strange things."
