# salute-jonathan

Side by side translation of Salute Jonathan

My demo: https://codinginthecold.alwaysdata.net/salute-jonathan/ 

Original project home: https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Salute,_Jonathan!

This repo is home to my personal translations and a data source for my side by side reading app. Feel free to raise issues and make pull requests. 

## Data format 

In the translations the format goes as follows...

    One or more empty lines.
    Some source line, usually English. 
    The line translated from the abouve (source) line. 
    One or more empty lines.

So each line of text has its own line, followed by at least one empty line.
